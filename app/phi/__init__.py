Protected Health Information (PHI)

The HIPAA's Privacy Rule protects all "individually identifiable health information" held or transmitted
by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral.

The Privacy Rule calls this information "protected health information (PHI).


"Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to:

* the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
* the provision of health care to the individual, or
* the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,
and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe
it can be used to identify the individual.

Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers
(e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).


De-Identified Health Information.

There are no restrictions on the use or disclosure of de-identified health information.
De-identified health information neither identifies nor provides a reasonable basis to identify an individual.
There are two ways to de-identify information; either:
(1) a formal determination by a qualified statistician; or
(2) the removal of specified identifiers of the individual and of the individual’s relatives, household members,
and employers is required, and is adequate only if the covered entity has no actual knowledge that the remaining
information could be used to identify the individual.
